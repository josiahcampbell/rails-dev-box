# A Virtual Machine for Ruby on Rails Development

## Introduction

Simple box to get started on Rails projects. While the original bootstrap shell
was meant for rails core development, I liked their `install` function.
## Requirements

* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)

* [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com)

## How To Build The Virtual Machine

Building the virtual machine is this easy:

    host $ git clone https://github.com/rails/rails-dev-box.git
    host $ cd rails-dev-box
    host $ vagrant up

That's it.

After the installation has finished, you can access the virtual machine with

    host $ vagrant ssh
    Welcome to Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.13.0-55-generic x86_64)
    ...
    vagrant@vagrant:~$

Port 3000 in the host computer is forwarded to port 3000 in the virtual machine. Thus, applications running in the virtual machine can be accessed via localhost:3000 in the host computer. Be sure the web server is bound to the IP 0.0.0.0, instead of 127.0.0.1, so it can access all interfaces:

    bin/rails s -b 0.0.0.0

## What's In The Box

* Development tools

* Git

* Ruby 2.3

* Bundler

* Postgres

* Database and user needed to run the Active Record test suite

* System dependencies for nokogiri, pg

* Redis

## Other notes

Vagrant mounts that directory as _/vagrant_ within the virtual machine:
```bash
vagrant@rails-dev-box:~$ ls /vagrant
bootstrap.sh README.md Vagrantfile
```
We are ready to go to edit in the host, and test in the virtual machine.

## Virtual Machine Management

When done just log out with `^D` and suspend the virtual machine

    host $ vagrant suspend
then, resume to hack again

    host $ vagrant resume

Run

    host $ vagrant halt

to shutdown the virtual machine, and

    host $ vagrant up

to boot it again.

You can find out the state of a virtual machine anytime by invoking

    host $ vagrant status

Finally, to completely wipe the virtual machine from the disk **destroying all its contents**:

    host $ vagrant destroy # DANGER: all is gone

Please check the [Vagrant documentation](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/) for more information on Vagrant.

## Faster Rails test suites

The default mechanism for sharing folders is convenient and works out the box in
all Vagrant versions, but there are a couple of alternatives that are more
performant.

### rsync

Vagrant 1.5 implements a [sharing mechanism based on rsync](https://www.vagrantup.com/blog/feature-preview-vagrant-1-5-rsync.html)
that dramatically improves read/write because files are actually stored in the
guest. Just throw

    config.vm.synced_folder '.', '/vagrant', type: 'rsync'

to the _Vagrantfile_ and either rsync manually with

    vagrant rsync

or run

    vagrant rsync-auto

for automatic syncs. See the post linked above for details.

### NFS

If you're using Mac OS X or Linux you can increase the speed of Rails test suites with Vagrant's NFS synced folders.

With an NFS server installed (already installed on Mac OS X), add the following to the Vagrantfile:

    config.vm.synced_folder '.', '/vagrant', type: 'nfs'
    config.vm.network 'private_network', ip: '192.168.50.4' # ensure this is available

Then

    host $ vagrant up

Please check the Vagrant documentation on [NFS synced folders](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/nfs.html) for more information.
